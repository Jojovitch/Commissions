## Details:
Model mostly based off the first character ref, but i included some extra so you got options

laying in a beanbag/pile of clothes for this. Whichever is easier to draw

Since i don't think you can see it in the shot, there are two little bumps near the base of the tentacle on either side, her fingers are on either side of it in the shot but it covers all the detail so can't really tell.
