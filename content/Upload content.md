This is a simple .Bat that uploads the content to github for hosting from inside obsidian. It won't do anything unless its inside an configured quarts content folder.

This page exists for the sole purpose of hosting it and explaining its purpose (cause i know y'all are gonna snoop)

![[Upload.bat]] Note: Will close your vault then takes 1-2 minutes for github to update the page, so if you steal this keep that in mind.
